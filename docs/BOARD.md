# GLAVNOE — MVP Board

> Lightweight status board. Orchestrator updates checkboxes as work lands.
> Statuses: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocked
> Full task detail lives in `/docs/agents/*-tasks.md`.

## Foundations (do first — everyone depends on these)
- [x] Product spec — `docs/SPEC.md`
- [x] Data model + Prisma — `docs/data-model.md`
- [x] API contract — `docs/api-spec.yaml`
- [x] Design tokens — `docs/design-tokens.json`
- [x] Orchestration + agent guides — `AGENTS.md`, `*/CLAUDE.md`

## Backend (see docs/agents/backend-tasks.md)
- [x] SETUP-01 Project scaffolding (Fastify + TS)
- [x] SETUP-02 Prisma schema + migration
- [x] SETUP-03 Fastify server + health check
- [x] AUTH-01..04 Register / Login / JWT middleware / Me
- [x] ITEMS-01..04 CRUD + ownership
- [x] STREAK-01..02 Get streak + update helper
- [x] SYNC-01 Sync endpoint (last-write-wins)
- [x] ENGINE-01 Rule redistribution (POST /api/v1/redistribute)

## Flutter (see docs/agents/flutter-tasks.md)
- [x] FL-SETUP-01..03 Project + Focus theme + 4-tab nav (profile = AppBar leading)
- [x] FL-DB-01..02 Drift schema + DAOs
- [x] FL-TODAY-01..05 Today screen (ring, streak, list, add sheet)
- [x] FL-PLAN-01..02 Week strip + day timeline
- [x] FL-DIARY-01 Diary form + morning review carry-over card
- [x] FL-API-01 / FL-SYNC-01 Dio client + sync service
- [x] Auth screen (login/register + offline mode) + router redirect + live sync on login
- [x] Themes Black + White (+ theme picker in Profile); Focus default. calm/contrast = stubs
- [x] Schedule import — paste/template (text → tasks) via Plan. photo/voice = AI Phase 1
- [x] Onboarding flow (first-run 3-slide intro → auth)
- [x] All 5 themes (Focus/Calm/Black/White/Contrast, contrast 1.15 type scale) + picker
- [x] Home widget (Android) — native AppWidgetProvider + MethodChannel bridge; verified on a real device (shows main progress + streak, tap opens app). iOS widget needs a Mac.

## QA (see docs/agents/qa-tasks.md)
- [x] QA-01 Auth flow
- [x] QA-02 Items CRUD
- [x] QA-03 Streaks
- [x] QA-04 Redistribution engine
- [x] QA-05 Sync conflict resolution
- [x] DoD: 36/36 tests pass (Jest+inject); engine coverage 100% lines (≥80% req); no AI calls (no ai/ code in MVP)

## Landing (see landing/CLAUDE.md)
- [x] index.html — hero, problem/solution, features, pricing, footer
- [x] Smart [Download] button (platform detection)

## AI — Phase 1 (paid; see docs/agents/ai-tasks.md)
- [x] AI-06 Schedule import from photo (premium): /api/v1/ai/schedule-import + Claude Haiku multimodal in src/ai/ + premium gate + Flutter photo button. Tests mock ai/ (4/4). Live run needs real ANTHROPIC_API_KEY + a premium user.
- [ ] AI-01 Smart redistribute · AI-02 morning message · AI-03 food photo · AI-04 diary insight · AI-05 weekly wrapped

## MVP Definition of Done
A free, no-AI app you use daily: accounts + sync, Today/Plan/Diary, rule-based review
(morning + evening + variants), schedule import, streaks + freeze, onboarding,
themes Focus/Black/White, home widget. All QA suites green.

## Smart Download button (Alpine.js)
```javascript
// Detect platform and redirect
function getDownloadUrl() {
  const ua = navigator.userAgent;
  if (/iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(ua)) {
    return 'https://apps.apple.com/app/glavnoe';     // placeholder
  } else if (/Android/.test(ua)) {
    return 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/glavnoe'; // placeholder
  } else {
    return 'https://app.glavnoe.com';                  // placeholder
  }
}
```

## Rules
- Mobile responsive — use Tailwind responsive prefixes (sm: md: lg:)
- No external images — use CSS/SVG placeholders for mockups
- Placeholder store links are fine — they'll be updated post-launch
- Keep it fast — CDN only, no custom JS bundle
- Tone: confident, warm, student-facing — matches the app's "gentle" voice
